### HAMOYE INTERNSHIP
Machine learning task assigned for stage C.
An indepth machine learning approach to solving a business problem using **CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM**
More accurate results was drived through the use of **Ensemble methods** such as RandomForestClassifer, ExtraTreesClassifier
To minimize the variance of the predictions, gradient boosting algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM were employed
Hyperparameter tuning was performed RandomizedSearchCV to reduce computational time.
