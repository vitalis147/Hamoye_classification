### HAMOYE INTERNSHIP
Machine learning task assigned for stage C.
An in-depth machine learning approach to solving a business problem using **CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM**.
More accurate results were derived using **Ensemble methods** (RandomForestClassifer, and ExtraTreesClassifier).
To minimize the variance of the predictions, gradient-boosting algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM were employed.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed through RandomizedSearchCV to reduce computational time.
